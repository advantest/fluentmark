### [Extension: `tex_math_dollars`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-tex_math_dollars)

Math expressions and formula can be written in LaTeX syntax between two `$` signs
for in-line expressions and between enclosed by `$$` for math expressions
in display mode (similar to LaTeX).

Examples:

Einstein's formula $E=mc^2$ is famous.

Formula in display mode (with a LaTeX command):

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$


Other expressions:
$$a_0+{1\over a_1+
      {1\over a_2+
        {1 \over a_3 + 
           {1 \over a_4}}}}$$

$$x_{1/2} = -\frac{p}{2}\pm \sqrt{\frac{p^2}{4}-q}$$
