### 6.7 Hard line breaks 

Lines ending with two or more space characters   
are interpreted as hard line breaks,  
i.e. the line breaks are rendered in HTML (`<br \>` tags are used).

Hard line breaks can be made better visible\
with a backslash at the end of line.


### 6.8 Soft line breaks

Regular line endings, not preceded by two or more space characters or a backslash
are interpreted as soft line breaks, i.e. the resulting source ode contains the line 
breaks, but it is not rendered as line breaks.
