Reactor and HTMLtoJSX
=========================

Reactor is an experimental library that uses the power of Facebook's
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library to support real-time
HTML updates to plain old HTML web-pages. Reactor is derived from 
Facebook's React-Magic.

[HTMLtoJSX](README-htmltojsx.md) is a component of React-Magic that converts
HTML to JSX.
